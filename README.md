# springboot-graphql-mysql

## Goal

The goal of this project is to implement an API that uses [GraphQL](https://graphql.org) and explore
what GrapghQL has to offer. `author-api` is a spring-boot application that has GraphQL endpoints together with the
traditional REST endpoints. `author-api` uses [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com) as storage. Besides, we will implement
another micro-service, called `author-client`, that will consume `author-api` and display the information in an user
friendly interface implemented using [Thymeleaf](https://www.thymeleaf.org).

**PS. It is a working in progress. Currently, we are finishing the REST endpoints. As soon as we finish it, we will
move to GraphQL endpoints implementation and, later, author-client**
